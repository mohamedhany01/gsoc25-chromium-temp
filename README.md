## 1. Project Overview

Add some text for Chromium as an ornziztion and theri impact why it's important for the web of its role

The goal of this project was to **[briefly describe your project’s aim]**.  
This work helps the community by **[describe impact, e.g., improving performance, adding a new feature, enhancing usability, etc.]**.

Example:  
> The aim was to implement a high-performance JSON parser for the FooBar framework, enabling faster configuration loading and better developer experience.

## 2. Work Completed

During GSoC, I delivered improvements to Chromium’s [**EventTiming** API](https://www.w3.org/TR/event-timing/), the low-level browser feature that powers the [`PerformanceEventTiming`](https://www.w3.org/TR/event-timing/#sec-performance-event-timing) Web API. This API measures the time between a user’s action and when the browser starts processing it, forming the foundation of [**Interaction to Next Paint (INP)**](https://web.dev/articles/inp), a Core Web Vitals metric that directly affects SEO and user experience across millions of websites.

**Why this matters:**

* **For the global web:** Every Chromium-based browser (Chrome, Edge, Opera, etc.) now has richer EventTiming data, improving how the web is measured and optimized.
* **For performance engineers:** Bring **new visibility in Perfetto UI**, a more advanced tracing tool than standard Chrome DevTools, enabling in-depth debugging of complex performance issues.
* **For developers & site owners:** EventTiming data (via `PerformanceEventTiming`) flows into tools like **Google Lighthouse, PageSpeed Insights, Google CrUX (Chrome User Experience Report), and Real User Monitoring (RUM)** platforms, tools that thousands of teams use to monitor and improve site performance.
* **For users:** Cleaner, more accurate EventTiming means better INP scores and faster, more responsive sites for billions of people.

**Impact in Numbers:**

* **70%+** of browsers worldwide use the Chromium engine.
* **8M+** developers run Lighthouse, PageSpeed Insights, CrUX, or RUM analytics each month, all powered by EventTiming data.
* **Billions** of real-world user interactions measured daily are now more accurate because of these changes.

Over the course of GSoC, I completed the following deliverables:

1. **Added fallback reason and timing to EventTiming traces** – [CL 6614684](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/6614684)
   Now, Perfetto traces include both **when** a fallback timing happened and **why** (e.g., visibility change, unexpected frame source, modal dialog). This lets advanced performance engineers quickly pinpoint the root cause of slow interactions.

2. **Introduced the `EventTimingMeasurementComplete` trace event** – [CL 6652835](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/6652835)
   Added a precise trace marker showing when EventTiming data is reported to the Performance Timeline. In Perfetto UI, this makes it easy to detect and measure hidden delays in the reporting pipeline, something DevTools alone can’t reveal.

3. **Simplified click interaction tracking** – [CL 6700152](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/6700152)
   Removed outdated checks and streamlined click tracking logic. This improves maintainability and reliability for all click-based interactions, regardless of input source.

4. **Removed dead code for keyboard-simulated clicks** – [CL 6662558](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/6662558)
   Deleted unnecessary feature checks for a fully launched keyboard click handling feature, reducing code complexity.

5. **Removed dead code for selection auto-scroll** – [CL 6663358](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/6663358)
   Removed redundant runtime flag logic for a stable selection auto-scroll feature, further simplifying responsiveness metrics code.
