## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to **provide developers with deeper insights into Interaction to Next Paint (INP), a Core Web Vital that measures web page responsiveness, by identifying, measuring, and reporting its subparts (such as input delay, event processing time, and rendering delays)**.

This work helps the community by **integrating INP subpart data into Chromiumâ€™s reporting pipeline and experimental datasets, giving developers actionable feedback to improve site performance and usability**.

Chromium, as an open-source browser that powers major browsers like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and others, plays a critical role in shaping web standards and ensuring performance metrics are consistent across the web. **By advancing INP observability in Chromium, this project strengthens the ecosystem of performance tooling, directly impacting how developers optimize responsiveness and ultimately improving user experiences across billions of devices worldwide.**

## Work Completed

During GSoC I worked with the [**Google Speed Metrics**](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/speed_metrics/README.md) team to improve and optimize the [**EventTiming**](https://www.w3.org/TR/event-timing/) API and the [`PerformanceEventTiming`](https://www.w3.org/TR/event-timing/#sec-performance-event-timing) Web API. These APIs are the base for [**Interaction to Next Paint (INP)**](https://web.dev/articles/inp), a Core Web Vital that affects search ranking, user experience, and site success.

### ðŸ”¹ Why it matters

* **Browsers**: Better EventTiming in all Chromium browsers (Chrome, Edge, Opera, etc.).
* **Engineers**: More powerful tracing in **Perfetto UI** than standard DevTools.
* **Developers**: Data flows into **DevTools, Lighthouse, PageSpeed Insights, CrUX, and other analytics tools** used worldwide.
* **Users**: Faster, smoother websites. Sites respond more quickly to taps, clicks, and key presses â†’ better usability, higher engagement, and stronger search ranking.

### Impact

*For developers*: This project makes **responsiveness debugging easier** by exposing the hidden details of INP inside tools like DevTools, Lighthouse, and Perfetto. Developers can now spot whether slowness comes from input delay, event handling, or rendering.

*For users*: These improvements mean **faster, smoother websites**. By helping developers identify bottlenecks, sites respond more quickly to taps, clicks, and key pressesâ€”leading to better usability, higher engagement, and stronger search ranking.

## What's Left to Do

If future contributors want to extend the project:

* Implement **[feature/optimization name]** for better performance.
* Add **[specific tests or features]** for edge cases.
* Improve integration with **[related component/tool]**.

TODO:

* need to fill this part

## Code Contributions

All of my GSoC-related code contributions are available through Chromium Gerrit review system. The [dashboard](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/q/owner:mohamedhyouns@gmail.com) provides a complete history of my submitted patches, code reviews, and merged changes, offering a clear view of the progress and technical impact of my work throughout the project.

## Challenges & Lessons Learned

**Challenges:**

* **Huge codebase:** Chromiumâ€™s millions of C++/Blink lines made it hard at first to trace how **input â†’ compositor â†’ renderer** connects with EventTiming.
* **Precision vs. overhead:** Adding trace events helped visibility but risked slowing performance, so I had to design **lightweight markers**.
* **Cross-team reviews:** My work touched EventTiming, Perfetto, and DevTools, so I needed to coordinate with multiple reviewers.

**Lessons Learned:**

* **Browser performance internals:** Gained hands-on knowledge of Chromiumâ€™s latency pipeline, Perfetto tracing, and Core Web Vitals.
* **Open-source best practices:** Writing clean commits, clear docs, and handling review feedback effectively.
* **Ecosystem perspective:** Saw how **low-level APIs (EventTiming)** feed into **tools (Lighthouse, CrUX, RUM)** and shape **business outcomes (SEO, UX, conversions)**.
* **Collaboration:** Improved skills in writing design docs, trade-off discussions, and clear technical communication.
