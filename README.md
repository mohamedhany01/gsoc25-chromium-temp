Chromium, as an open-source browser that powers major browsers like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and others, plays a critical role in shaping web standards and ensuring performance metrics are consistent across the web. By advancing INP observability in Chromium, this project strengthens the ecosystem of performance tooling, directly impacting how developers optimize responsiveness and ultimately improving user experiences across billions of devices worldwide.

The goal was to report INP subparts: input delay, event processing time, and rendering delay, from the rendering side to the browser side via the Chrome User Experience Report (CrUX). These insights are now available in tools like DevTools, Lighthouse, and PageSpeed Insights, helping developers analyze and improve responsiveness.

For everyday users, this means smoother, faster interactions pages respond quickly to clicks, taps, and typing, leading to frustration-free browsing.

## Work Completed

Over the summer, I contributed to improving the [**EventTiming**](https://www.w3.org/TR/event-timing/) API and the [`PerformanceEventTiming`](https://www.w3.org/TR/event-timing/#sec-performance-event-timing) Web API, the foundation for [**Interaction to Next Paint (INP)**](https://web.dev/articles/inp), a Core Web Vital that directly impacts search ranking, user experience, and site success. These contributions strengthened Chromiumâ€™s responsiveness pipeline and now give developers and site owners more accurate, actionable insights into interaction performance.

### Deliverables & Status

**[Request presentation time only when painting](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/6760194) â€” ðŸŸ¡ Under Review**

Optimized EventTiming by aligning presentation time strictly with real paints, eliminating redundant callbacks and reducing performance overhead. This gave developers more accurate metrics while ensuring site owners received reliable data in tools like Lighthouse and CrUX.

---

**[Added fallback reason & timing](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/6614684) â€” âœ… Merged**

Extended EventTiming to capture *when* and *why* slow interactions fell back (e.g., visibility change, modal dialog, unexpected frame). This made the root cause of delays immediately visible in traces, speeding up debugging and reducing engineering effort.

---

**[New trace event: `MeasurementComplete`](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/6652835) â€” âœ… Merged**

Added a trace marker to pinpoint when EventTiming data was reported, bridging the gap between GPU presentation and timeline reporting. This helped developers quickly spot bottlenecks and optimize responsiveness more efficiently.

---

**[Simplified click tracking](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/6700152) â€” âœ… Merged**

Simplified click interaction logic by removing obsolete histograms and trusting `pointer_id` across all click sources. This reduced complexity, improved reliability, and lowered the chance of future bugs.

---

**[Removed old keyboard-click code](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/6662558) â€” âœ… Merged**

Deleted obsolete runtime checks for keyboard click handling, since the feature was already fully launched. This cleanup reduced technical debt and kept Chromium easier to maintain.

---

**[Removed old selection auto-scroll code](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/6663358) â€” âœ… Merged**

Cleaned up unused runtime logic for selection auto-scroll, which was already stable and permanently enabled. This kept the codebase leaner and more sustainable for future development.

### Why it matters

- **Engineers**: More powerful tracing in [**Perfetto UI**](https://ui.perfetto.dev/) than standard DevTools.
- **Developers**: Richer insights available in **DevTools, Lighthouse, [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/), CrUX, and other analytics tools** used worldwide.
- **Users**: Faster, smoother websites. Sites respond more quickly to taps, clicks, and key presses â†’ better usability, higher engagement, and stronger search ranking.

**Note:** All contributions are available on [Chromium Gerrit](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/q/owner:mohamedhyouns@gmail.com), including submitted patches, reviews, and merged changes from this project.

## Challenges & Lessons Learned

### Challenges

- **Scale of Chromium:** Navigating a codebase with millions of lines across C++, Blink, and rendering pipelines made it difficult to trace how input events flow through to responsiveness metrics.

- **System-wide complexity:** INP and EventTiming span multiple subsystems (input, rendering, compositing, metrics), so changes required careful cross-component understanding rather than isolated edits.

- **Ensuring reliability:** New tracing and observability features had to be both accurate and low-overhead, balancing developer visibility with end-user performance.

- **Maintaining stability:** Cleaning up legacy paths and simplifying event tracking demanded caution to avoid regressions for accessibility or edge cases.
- **Heavy build process:** Even with [GOMA](https://chromium.googlesource.com/infra/goma/client/+/ac9d3edd78849599d1fa5db65992e768ba0568ac/README.md) and distributed builds in the cloud, full Chromium builds were long and resource-intensive, slowing down iteration cycles.

- **Challenging debugging workflow:** Debugging required a combination of tracing, Perfetto UI, DevTools, and custom instrumentation, often across multiple iterations to isolate subtle timing issues.

- **Long review process:** Because these were **critical, user-facing performance metrics**, every change required multiple senior reviews, detailed justifications, and iteration before acceptance.

### Lessons Learned

- **Software engineering & collaboration best practices:** Improved at writing clean commits, maintaining clear documentation, and handling review feedback effectively, while also sharpening skills in design docs, trade-off discussions, and clear technical communication.

- **End-to-end SDLC exposure:** Worked across the full development lifecycle, from clarifying high-level, often ambiguous requirements, to adding new features, fixing bugs, optimizing performance, updating/fixing tests, refactoring legacy code, and cleaning up unused logic. This experience strengthened my ability to deal with uncertainty while still delivering reliable outcomes.

- **Browser engineering & internals:** Gained hands-on experience in a critical, complex, and niche domain where few engineers get direct exposure. Worked inside Chromiumâ€™s latency pipeline, Perfetto tracing, and Core Web Vitals, areas that directly influence web standards, SEO, and user experience for billions of users worldwide.

- **Learning from experts:** Benefited from close collaboration with the Chrome Speed Metrics team at Google, learning from their mentorship, design discussions, and detailed reviews. This helped me grow a stronger professional engineering mindset and higher standards for quality.
